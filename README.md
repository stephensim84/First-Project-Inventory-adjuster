# First-Project

As a user, I want to be able to acess a database (in our example inventory), so I can spefic information(like product name, amounts and prices).

As a user, I want to apply changes to any elements in the database. For example; if we have over-stocked items, apply discounts to these items. 

As a user, I want these changes to be applied on the site, without changing the original database.
